Within the First Imperial Stormtrooper Detachment (FISD) there are 3 levels of approval:

 1. Basic approval
 1. Expert Infantry Battalion
 1. Centurion

With the increase of each level from 1&ndash;3 higher emphasis is placed on the accuracy of the armour to the film used originals.

Today I passed my Level 2: EIB certification.

There were a few dressing errors I will need to address and some small details I need to address before I am ready to apply for level 3: Centurion.
