On 28th April, 2016 after years of dreaming I was accepted into the UK Garrison as TK-10911.

My first experience of the UKG and the 501st Legion was a work party on 14th September 2005.  Whilst waiting to go in, out through the gates marched Lord Vader and a small number of Stormtroopers.  This instantly drew my attention and was something I'd think about for the years that followed.

Joining the world famous UKG and 501st Legion is a dream come true.
